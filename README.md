# GTEx Pro Pipeline — Web Application Version

### **Note**
For full functionality and robust preprocessing, please use the GTEx Pro Web Application:  
👉 **https://multi-tissue-rnaseq.lovable.app/**

---

## **Overview**
GTEx Pro provides a powerful, user-friendly interface for high-quality GTEx multi-tissue gene expression analysis.  
This web platform replaces the need to run pipeline code locally, offering automated preprocessing, normalization, and batch correction directly in the browser.

The academic web version is provided free of charge for limited analysis. All backend processing uses the same validated methods from the original pipeline, ensuring precision and reproducibility.

---

## **Features**
- Upload raw read counts and select gene IDs and tissues directly in the interface  
- Automated robust normalization using TMM + CPM  
- Batch correction using SVA  
- Clean visualizations and downloadable expression matrices  
- No installation required — everything runs in the cloud  
- Built-in feedback portal for user suggestions

---

## **How to Use**
1. Visit **https://multi-tissue-rnaseq.lovable.app/**
2. Upload your raw expression data and metadata files
3. Choose tissues and provide your genes of interest
4. Run preprocessing and download your outputs
5. Provide feedback inside the app to help improve the platform
